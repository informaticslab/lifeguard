<p style="padding-top:10px;">To assure that data is being transmitted, on your phone, go to: <i>Settings > Privacy > Location Services > CDC Lifeguard</i></p>
<p>Confirm that “Always” is selected (you will see a check mark).</p>
<p>To disable the reporting function, select “Never” instead of “Always.”</p>
<p>To shut down the application from running in the background, double-tap the home button, swipe left or right with your finger to navigate to CDC Lifeguard, and then swipe your finger up.  You will see the application deleted from the screen – and is now shut down.  To restart the application, simply press the Lifeguard icon on the home screen.</p>
